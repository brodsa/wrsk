\usage{
wrk(data, D, k, max.iter = 30, cutoff = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data matrix with n observations and p variables.}

\item{D}{A distance matrix.}

\item{k}{The number of clusters.}

\item{max.iter}{The maximum number of iterations to reach local optimum, the default is 30.}

\item{cutoff}{A cutoff value to determine outliers. An observation is
declared as an outlier if its weight is smaller than or equal to this cutoff, the default is 0.5.}
}
\value{
\item{clusters}{An integer vector with values from 1 to k, indicating a resulting cluster membership.}
\item{obsweights}{A numeric vector of observation weights ranging between 0 and 1.}
\item{outclusters}{An integer vector with values from 0 to k, containing both cluster membership and identified outliers.
0 corresponds to outlier.}
\item{WCSS}{The within-cluster sum of squares of the local optimum.}
\item{centers}{The set of cluster centers.}
}
\description{
This function performs robust (weighted) k-means clustering which is very useful in case of contaminated data. The method
aims at detecting both clusters and outliers.
}
\details{
\code{wrk} initializes the clustering procedure by ROBIN approach and
incorporates a weighting function on each detected clusters during k-means clustering.
The weighting function uses LOF in order to assign a weight for each observation. The resulting observation weights reflect
a degree of outlyingness and range between 0 and 1. These weights are used to
identify outliers as observations with a weight \code{<=cutoff}.
